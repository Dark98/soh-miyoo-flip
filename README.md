## Installation
Follow the guide at the [Ship of Harkinian website](https://www.shipofharkinian.com/setup-guide) for your desired platform to create your oot.otr and/or oot-mq.otr files. Once created put in the `ports/soh` folder. Texture pack files can be added to the `ports/soh/mods` folder.

## Graphics Adjustments
You can modify `config.ini` to toggle common settings including built-in presets: `default, vanillaplus, enhanced, custom`. If you want to make changes beyond the presets, do `preset=custom` in the ini file. An invalid entry will load the default preset.

## Further Adjustments
There is a `gptk` file you can use to change which button emulates F1 (default is L3). Once you do so, make the menu bar appear, hold the north button (X or Y), press R, then press the north button again to access the menu bar navigation.

The GUI may be too large or small. Navigate to Settings->Graphics->IMGUI Menu Scale to change it.

## Default Gameplay Controls
The port uses SDL controller mapping.
